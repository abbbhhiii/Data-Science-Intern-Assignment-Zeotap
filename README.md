# Customer Analytics Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the Customer Analytics Assignment, which involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and performing Customer Segmentation/Clustering. Each task includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and reports summarizing the findings.

Contents
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

Objective: Perform EDA to extract patterns and derive actionable business insights.
Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb: Python code for EDA.
FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf: A report with five key business insights.


Task 2: Lookalike Model

Objective: Build a model that identifies and recommends the top 3 most similar customers for a given user based on profile and transaction data.
Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb: Python code for Lookalike Model development.
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv: Output file containing the mapping of the first 20 customers (C0001 - C0020) to their top 3 lookalikes and similarity scores.


Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

Objective: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb: Python code for clustering.
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.csv: Output file with cluster assignments for each customer.
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf: Report with clustering metrics, DB Index, and visualizations.
